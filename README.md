# `stac`
Silly stack-oriented simple programming language

# NOTE: being discontinued, stack programming languages are not fun to use.... i may come back to this later

## Example

Currently you can do stuff like this:
```
// push 42 and 10 to the stack
42 10
// 42 * 10
*
// dump prints out to stdout
dump

0 ret  // return
```

But, the vision for the Language is this:
```
func main int ptr -> int do
    if 1 then
        "Hello, World!" puts
    end
end
```
